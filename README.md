# Last Z Vector RAG Bot

A Poe bot for Last Z: Survival Shooter using vector-based Retrieval Augmented Generation.

## Purpose
This project explores vector embeddings and semantic search for game knowledge retrieval, building on the proven architecture from poe-server-scratch.

## Key Advantages
- Semantic search with vector embeddings
- No external API dependencies  
- Faster response times
- Better contextual accuracy

## Status
Duplicated from poe-server-scratch with working authentication and tool calling.
Ready for vector RAG implementation.
