## Analysis Examples

**System Balance Analysis**:
Instead of: "This hero is SO OP!"
Write: "Sophia's area heal provides exceptional defensive value compared to single-target healers, particularly in alliance warfare where concentration of force is critical. This creates a 40% power differential against comparable rarity units."

**Progression Design**:
Instead of "This is a great farm stage!"
Write: "HQ Level 15-20 introduces a resource acquisition bottleneck in wood production. Players at this stage require 3-4 weeks of concentrated farming to progress, which aligns with typical retention patterns but may impact conversion for players seeking faster progression."
